IUEE-Group8
===========
Things that work at release:
----------------------------
* Website is now demo functional - not all features are implemented fully.
* Login to facebook works but does not afford any storage of information / progress.
* Basically ready to demonstrate future features to be added.

Future work:
------------
* Port system over to Meteor or similiar javascript framework to enable database storage and rapid development.
* Development of in-house games that tie-in to the curriculum that is developed.
* User database system that uses Facebook logins to store information.
* Functional leaderboard instead of demo.
